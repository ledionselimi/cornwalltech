Practicing git for CornwallTech work experience.

Hello Mission to Mars!

\## Story 1: Building the rover

Learnt a lot about file explorer and how to use git in the terminal with slight experience in GitHub. 

The steps were not clear enough on having to relocate after the ssh key, so I kept making a README file in the key folder.

Ask for help sooner.
