Practicing git for CornwallTech work experience.

Hello Mission to Mars!

\## Story 1: Building the rover

Learnt a lot about file explorer and how to use git in the terminal with slight experience in GitHub.

The steps were not clear enough on having to relocate after the ssh key, so I kept making a README file in the key folder.

Ask for help sooner.

Followed TechCornwall course 'TinkerCad Tutorial' and experimented with tutorial and given code of 3 LEDs flickering. Added potentiometer and pushbutton.



Following YouTube tutorial as I only used TechCornwall guide prior. Opened ReadMe in notepad, added text, saved ready to push back to GitHub. Adding Story 2.



Story 2: TinkerCad LEDs alternatively flashing

Followed TinkerCad image guide showing two LEDs, two 220 ohm resistors, Arduino Uno R3 and a solderless breadboard. I sourced code specific to making the LEDs flash alternatively. Gained fundamental TinkerCad and Arduino IDE knowledge.



Story 2a: Followed YouTube tutorial and learnt how to add variables and functions.



Story 3: Used TinkerCad Arduino board and set a pattern to 6 LEDs with three colours: green, yellow, red signifying move forward, stop, reverse. Coded using TinkerCad blocks. 1 of the red LEDs will not turn on, even after rewiring so I asked Robert for help.

I have rearranged the LEDs using the image guide and everything is working as it should.



Story 4: Followed YouTube tutorial and added variables and functions to my code in Story 3. Re-wrote using text.



Story 5: Wrote code to instruct the rover to move in a "snake" pattern, alternating the speeds of the left and right motors. Did not loop.
